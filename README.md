# Actor Name Program

## Description
This repo was built for the Yesware full stack engineer position code exercise. 
The objective was to write a program that processes an included example file that contains people's names, outputs some statistics and generates output.

Project planning can be found in the Projects tab under the [yesware-code-exercise project in GitHub](https://github.com/RMartin0717/yesware-code-exercise/projects/1) and as annotations to the [testing instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/121xnO16QOjYMcMxcNrir6-dmjQHdKSOjwjqFjX3PVPY/edit).

## Installation and Instructions
Clone this repo locally.
Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
Run `node actor-name-program.js` from the root of the project in the command line to execute code.
